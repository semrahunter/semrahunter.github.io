In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, the annual Smart City Expo took a unique hybrid approach to this yearâ€™s World Congress event. I was one of three who hosted the 10 hour non-stop live coverage from a studio based in Barcelona for audiences in 144 countries across the globe.

The event included both sit-down and virtual in-depth conversations in English and Spanish with nearly 250 guest speakers ranging from various city leaders to experts with the focus on developing greener and more sustainable cities for the future. Keynote speakers included high-profile members of governments, CEOs and VPs of major corporations, innovators in the field of green technology plus many others.

I also had the pleasure of hosting the World Smart City Awards Gala, a prestigious international competition which recognizes pioneers for their innovative ideas and projects which aim to improve the quality of life. While high-level entries were made from 46 countries worldwide, only seven winners were selected across different categories.
