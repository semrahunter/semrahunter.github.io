As of the start of 2020, LaLiga TV has found a new home in the UK and Ireland with Premier Sports, as well as Virgin Media and Sky. To make the announcement public, it was decided that an exclusive unveiling of the partnership would be organized.

LaLiga President, Javier Tebas, Mauricio Pochettino and Gustavo Poyet were involved as special guests, along with the more than a hundred of the most respected sports journalists in attendance.

I had the immense satisfaction to be the MC for the launch event. It was my job to prepare and share on stage with invitees a detailed explanation of what fans can expect when they tune into the unique channel, wholly dedicated to the top flight of Spanish football.

It was also a tremendous pleasure to have welcomed Javier Tebas on stage for a discussion in Spanish and later in English with Spanish football expert, Guillem Balagu√©, about some of the most pressing themes relevant to the current state of the league.
