Apart from my main work as a presenter with LaLiga TV, I also collaborate with other media outlets across the globe in a punditry role as a Spanish football expert. In my television or radio appearances, I discuss anything from LaLiga to Spanish teams in the Champions Leagues or the Spanish national team and their various competitions. 

I also cover major breaking news stories - such as the Lionel Messi burofax bombshell in the summer of 2020, the Barcelona club financial and Bartomeu board situation during the same time period or the departure of Gareth Bale from Real Madrid on loan to Spurs. 

While I currently collaborate regularly with Sky Sports News and the BBC World Service, I have also worked with BBC 5Live, BBC Sport, BBC Football Focus, FIFA TV, Premier League Productions, CBS Sports HQ, TRT World, Soccer Laduma and more.
