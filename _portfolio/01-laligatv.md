LaLiga President, Javier Tebas, has long desired to grow the Spanish football league’s popularity across the globe from the day he stepped into office. The creation of a unique television channel, exclusively dedicated to the top tier of professional football in Spain, was one of the core ideas that he wished to implement as a way of helping to make LaLiga more accessible to fans abroad. From that point on, LaLiga TV was born.

The 2018-19’ season was the first full campaign for the official international LaLiga channel. I was brought in to front the match day coverage as the host of all the pre- and post- match coverage for every game, live and unscripted from the studio. A position that I’m very passionate about and continue to perform today.

But I’m not alone! I’m always in the wonderful company of top former footballers, managers, Spanish football journalists and commentators, all of whom provide invaluable expertise and insight which have enriched the overall quality of the channel. They include Gustavo Poyet, Terry Gibson, Lauren Etame-Mayer, Nayim, Andrea Orlandi, Quinton Fortune, Guillem Balagué, Graham Hunter, Toni Padilla, and many more.

When I’m not completely immersed in football debates in the studio with colleagues, I take the conversation on the road. I regularly travel across Spain for in-depth interviews with some of the best and biggest stars from every club across the league in English and Spanish, including the likes of Marc-André Ter Stegen, Toni Kroos, Ivan Rakitic, Marc Bartra and more.

Having said all that, this video clip is a mixture of some of my personal highlights - both in the studio and out in the field - from our maiden season introducing ourselves into homes of LaLiga fans the world over.
