MetaSoccer is the first game launched of its kind in the newly established metaverse. The idea behind the game is that it’s a crossover between fantasy football and football manager, but with NFTs. All characters of the game (players, managers, club staff, etc.) are fictional, with the exception of a few real-life players which appear in the game. Arsenal’s Thomas Partey was the first.

To make the announcement, MetaSoccer wanted to go big. I presented the official launch (digital video) and also went to Partey’s house for an exclusive sit-down  interview, all of which we recorded on site in London.
