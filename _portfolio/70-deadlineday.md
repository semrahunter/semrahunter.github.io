Fabrizio Romano has become a cultural phenomenon as the guru of football transfers. His expertise on the subject really goes into full force on deadline day. For the close of the 2022 winter transfer market, Heineken sponsored a live 12-hour stream on Twitch with Fabrizio and his partner, Francesco Porzio, as they reported transfer news as it happened.

I was invited to join the team as co-host of the event, which was held in Amsterdam at the Heineken Experience. My role included presenting the latest news with Fabrizio and Francesco, holding conversations with Skype guests, fielding questions from viewers and most importantly, keeping the flow of the conversation going with dynamism and energy throughout the day.

In total, the stream captured almost 1.5 million unique views by the nightâ€™s close.
