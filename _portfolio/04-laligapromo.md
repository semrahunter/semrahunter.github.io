As part of the global kickoff for the 2020-21 season, LaLiga created a promotional video detailing innovative new technologies that would be introduced as part of the live broadcasting of games.

As one of the main faces of the league’s international broadcast, it was a huge honor to present the promotional video on behalf of LaLiga in both English and Spanish.

Some of the key elements of the video shared with media outlets across the world include the explanation behind the implementation of augmented reality, 3D graphics, data analytic features and much more.

To make the promotional video more interactive and fun, filming took place in key parts of the LaLiga HQ and Atlético de Madrid’s state of the art stadium, the Wanda Metropolitano.
