In the early months of 2020 - a brand new decade that filled us with the promise of exciting new ventures ahead - the new year took a turn for the worse. COVID-19 had spread across the globe at an alarming rate, and put life as we knew it on hold.

In Spain, where I’m based, the situation became very serious in a very short space of time. From one day to the next, we were all sent home to self-quarantine and to follow strict protective measures - not just for our own benefit, but for that of everyone else, as well.

A strange new reality for all of us, but one in which I wanted to try to make the most out of, given the circumstances. Just because football - and just about everything else for that matter - had to have a pin put in it, didn’t mean that discussions had to stop, too.

That inspired me to create a weekly live chat series on Periscope / Twitter / Instagram called TeaTimeTalks with former footballers, managers, top journalists and more outstanding people from LaLiga TV and the world of football. They include Gustavo Poyet, Terry Gibson, Lauren Etame-Mayer, Nayim, Andrea Orlandi, Quinton Fortune, Guillem Balagué, Graham Hunter, Toni Padilla, and many more. In the absence of action on the pitch, it was my aim to keep the conversation going, all while having a bit of fun to help lift spirits during these extraordinary times that kept us indoors for months.

It’s been such a joy and a phenomenal way for me to keep my morale high. I can only hope that it also helped to brighten the day for those who tuned in at some stage, if even only for just a moment.
