Since 2018, I’ve had the fantastic opportunity to dive into the virtual football world with Gerard Piqué’s esports company eFootballPro / EMR in partnership with Konami. The objective was to continue to grow their brand and top product - Pro Evolution Soccer, now known as eFootball. EMR has been responsible for organizing the European and World Finals since the 2018 PES League World Tour, for which they brought me in to host.

That season there were three rounds of European Finals - in Barcelona, Milan and Berlin - with the tour making its final stop, once again, in Barcelona for the World Finals. Each competition lasted eleven hours, all of which was live streamed by hundreds of thousands of PES fans across the globe.

Each competition had challengers for the crown in two types of modes - 1v1 and co-op. While the players were focused on vying for efootball glory, my purpose was as the main conductor of the event, the person who tied the day together smoothly from start to finish in as fun and entertaining a way possible.

Some of my main responsibilities included the presentation of the day’s event, presentation of each round of competition, player introductions, player interviews pre- and post- matches and award ceremonies.

In 2022, while my role remains the same, the competition format changed. Some of the biggest football clubs on the planet - FC Barcelona, Manchester United, Arsenal, Celtic FC, to name a few - have formed their own professional esports teams. The tournament is a 1v1 knockout style competition between eight clubs where each field a three-man team. This season’s competition has amassed more than seven million views in total on YouTube alone.
