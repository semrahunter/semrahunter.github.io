One of the most immense privileges I’ve had throughout my career has been the ability to sit down and spend quality time with some of the biggest legends the sports world has ever seen. Nothing quite compares to being told, face-to-face, not only about how each athlete has been able to make their wildest dream a reality, but the crazy tales and sidebar stories which bring such laughter, joy and appreciation that make the time spent with them truly special.

During my time with RealMadrid TV, my role as both presenter and reporter allowed me to come in contact on a regular basis with members of both the squad and coaching staff. Most often I found myself speaking with players like Gareth Bale, Luka Modric and Toni Kroos, along with managers Carlos Ancelotti and Rafa Benítez.

It was when I moved to TRT World that the breadth of interviews I would go on to conduct across a wide variety of sports would become amplified. My role as a correspondent would take me all across Europe and the Middle East for the purpose of holding extensive conversations with all-time greats, such as Usain Bolt, Michael Phelps, Simone Biles, Xavi Hernández, Carles Puyol, Luis Figo, Fabio Capello, Boris Becker, David Coulthard, Nadia Comăneci, and more.

That vast experience has laid the foundation for me to better execute my current role as lead interviewer for LaLiga TV. It’s a position I relish, and one in which I’ve had the fortune of having clubs across the league open their doors so welcomingly to allow for meaningful conversations with players, oftentimes up to an hour.
