To celebrate the 90th anniversary of the competition, LaLiga rolled out the red carpet for a special presentation of its ambassadors for the 2020-21 season. I had the absolute honor of presenting the major event, and in my second language, Spanish.

During the two hour long presentation, I had the pleasure of interviewing some of the world’s leading figures in Spanish football, such as LaLiga President, Javier Tebas, as well as league sponsors including Banco Santander, Puma, EA Sports, Budweiser, LiveScore and many more in both Spanish and English.

It was also an immense privilege to be able to both call up onto the stage, and later interview directly, legends of the game such as Carles Puyol, Samuel Eto’o, Luis Garcia, Diego Forlan, Fernando Morientes, Gaizka Mendieta, Aritz Aduriz, Christian Karembeu, David Albelda, Xabi Prieto, Fernando Hierro, Guti plus many, many more.
