While LaLiga has always been a major focal point throughout my career, it’s far from the only league that I’ve covered. Both during my time with RealMadrid TV and later with TRT World, I’ve been actively reporting on the Champions League. This entails both pre- and post- match coverage from pitch side positions, as well as the mixed zone.

In 2014, I had the tremendous privilege of providing live-as-it-happens reporting from the early afternoon at the Santiago Bernabéu until the sun came up over the Plaza de Cibeles on the night of Real Madrid’s historic 4-1 victory in a first ever final between two teams from the same city. A fierce derby, no less.

Átletico de Madrid had taken the lead, but thanks to the heroics of Sergio Ramos that will forever live in the memory of every Madridista on the planet, 92:48’ would be etched into history books as one of the greatest ever football comeback moments, just as Los Blancos would become the first club to hit double digits in the European Cup by ‘finally’ lifting La Décima in Lisbon.

It wouldn’t be the only Madrid derby I’d cover in a UCL final, as two years later in 2016, I was pitch side in Milan for another epic clash between them. History would repeat itself with Sergio Ramos scoring again - this time giving Zinedine Zidane’s side the lead. But it wouldn’t be until Diego Simeone’s outfit took the game to a penalty shootout that Real Madrid would go on to raise Ol’ Big Ears for the 11th time.
