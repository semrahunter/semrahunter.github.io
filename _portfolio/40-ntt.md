The Tour de France is the greatest cycling race on the planet. As one of the most incredible sporting events ever established, year on year the crème de la crème of the cycling world captivate fans near and far as they challenge for the iconic yellow jersey. Along the way, every single second is accounted for in the greatest detail imaginable - speed, time, distance… the list goes on. But ever wonder how all that data is captured? 

I had the privilege of hosting an exclusive live sports show for NTT, the official technology partner of the Tour de France, to answer this very question - plus so much more. The global interactive event was entirely virtual and enhanced by cutting-edge augmented reality from NTT’s Virtual Sports Studio. From our studio in Madrid, I was able to connect with top special guests including the CEO of the ASO, which owns the Tour de France, former pro-cyclists, as well as the NTT tech leaders responsible for creating the very technology which powers the race. 

A brilliant session full of fascinating cycling stories and high-quality conversation mixed in with some pretty mind-bending technology!
