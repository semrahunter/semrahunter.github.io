In addition, I travel across the country on a weekly basis to conduct exclusive, in-depth interviews with some of the best football stars, as well as promising newcomers. These interviews are done with every club across the league, in both English and Spanish, with players such as Marc-André Ter Stegen, Ivan Rakitic, Toni Kroos, Martin Ødegaard and Marc Bartra.
