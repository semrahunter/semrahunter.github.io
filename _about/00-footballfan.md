Hi there! I'm Semra. Welcome, and thank you for stopping by. Please allow me to tell you a little about myself. Iâ€™m a Los Angeles native where, aged three, I picked up a soccer ball for the first time...and never looked back. Sports - particularly European football - started off as a hobby, but quickly became the focus of my entire life. I very actively played a wide variety of sports throughout my life, and even became a Junior Olympic volleyball champion when I was 17. I have long been vested in the sports world, which made the shift from avid athlete to sports broadcast journalist the perfect fit.
