In the early months of my return to Spain, I also joined LaLiga TV where I have been working as a lead presenter for all of LaLiga TV's weekend coverage of every game on LaLiga Live - unscripted and live - from Friday evening through Saturday and Sunday. Each broadcast also includes expert analysis by top former footballers and leading Spanish football journalists as in-studio guest pundits.
