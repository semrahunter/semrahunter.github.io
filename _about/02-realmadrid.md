During my time with the club, I hosted several studio shows in both English and Spanish - The Match, Extra Time, Real Madrid Life - while also covering games and conducting weekly interviews with Real Madrid players and coaches. In the summer of 2015, I traveled with the team to cover their pre-season tour in Australia and China, while also presenting several special programmes for Real Madrid Life.
