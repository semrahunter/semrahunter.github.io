For the show, as well as for news programmes, I covered some of the best sporting events on the planet - including the 2016 European Championship in France, the Champions League and finals, 2022 World Cup preparations in Qatar, Laureus World Sports Awards red carpet, Euroleague Final Four, and more. During which time I had the absolute honour of interviewing some of the sporting worldâ€™s greatest legends - Xavi Hernandez, Michael Phelps, Usain Bolt, Carles Puyol, Claude Makelele, Luis Figo, Fabio Capello, and more.
