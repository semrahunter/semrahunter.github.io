After securing rights for 10 LaLiga matches a season, ITV sought me out to head up their top-quality coverage as studio presenter. A role in which I host pre-match, half-time, and post-match shows alongside football legends and journalists who provide expert game analysis. Matches always include one of the three biggest clubs in Spanish football: Real Madrid, FC Barcelona, and Atl√©tico de Madrid.
