After eight years of life in Spain, I traded Madrid for Turkey. Based in Istanbul, I took on a role as Sports Anchor and Correspondent for the then newly established international broadcast network, TRT World. Entering the channel during its formative stage, I had the opportunity to be part of a team which created a brand new 30-minute daily sports show, Beyond The Game.
