Now based in Barcelona, I also teamed up with eFootballPro / EMR as their host of Konami's PES League World Tour 2018 for the European rounds in Barcelona, Milan and Berlin, as well as for the World Finals in Barcelona for both co-op and 1v1 modes of competition. Each individual event was made up of 11 hours of live streaming including presentation of the event, presentation of each round of competition, player presentations, player interviews pre- and post- matches, award ceremonies, and more.
